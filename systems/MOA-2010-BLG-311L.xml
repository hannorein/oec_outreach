			<description>This object was observed in a gravitational microlensing event. A good mass estimate could not be obtained although the object is most likely of planetary nature. Unfortunately microlensing events are not repeatable and the planet is therefore marked as controversial. The lens may be a member of the globular cluster NGC 6553.</description>
